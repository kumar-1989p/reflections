What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repo, a dir with name .git gets created, where all the metadata regarding your dir is stored.

This is done, to start a repo, basically, version control. If you need to have some files on git, this is how you begin.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area differs from the working directory, that it is the next level. It is one level short of being committed. Once a git commit is given, all files present in staging area, will be committed, but not from working directory.

Gives time to think for a sec, if we are entirely sure to commit or not. No matter how many of them say they are correct, you still need to check once before you commit, especially if it's a life and death situation development, and especially in a product development, where a small mistake could bring down servers, and could easily cost you your job.
