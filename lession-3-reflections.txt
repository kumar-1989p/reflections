When would you want to use a remote reporsitory rather than keeping all your work local?

Especially while working in a team, or a group project. 
Or while working on something from 2 different locations, like work and home. Use the desktop or laptop at home, and use the work desktop at work. Helps both ways.

*******************************************

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If it happened automatically, it might actually end up pulling updates while a development was in progress, or a project was in progress.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is creating your own remote. For example, there is a mainline branch, and then you can't directly commit to it. So you fork the mainline thing, and and do whatever changes you want, on it. And then, once you think it's worth it, you merger your fork with the mainline thing using a pull request. If you have only 1 fork, you tend to call it origin


Clone is a clone of the online thing on your local. So if you create any repo on (prefereably) github, you need a copy of it on your local as well. So you clone it.


Branch is local thing. How fork is online, similarly, branch is a local thing. Preferably called as master (the first branch that you create)

********************************************

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can remember how was your last task, or rather what was your last task.

Also make sure, you can work without an internet connection.




********************************************

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Probably use the number markings courtesy form Iron Man mark armours like Mark I, Mark II, Mark III, and so on, like how I did on my resume, which now has gone to the dogs literally, coz I didn't bother updating properly.

Git is much easier, coz I would have a central repo from where I can control my resume from wherever I want to. Even from Sunburn if it comes to that!
