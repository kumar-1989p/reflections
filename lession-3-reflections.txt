When would you want to use a remote reporsitory rather than keeping all your work local?

Especially while working in a team, or a group project. 
Or while working on something from 2 different locations, like work and home. Use the desktop or laptop at home, and use the work desktop at work. Helps both ways.

*******************************************

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If it happened automatically, it might actually end up pulling updates while a development was in progress, or a project was in progress.
