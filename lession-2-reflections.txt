What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repo, a dir with name .git gets created, where all the meta data regarding your dir is stored.

This is done, to start a repo, basically, version control. If you need to have some files on git, this is how you begin.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area differs from the working directory, that it is the next level. It is one level short of being committed. Once a git commit is given, all files present in staging area, will be committed, but not from working directory.

Gives time to think for a sec, if we are entirely sure to commit or not. No matter how many of them say they are correct, you still need to check once before you commit, especially if it's a life and death situation development, and especially in a product development, where a small mistake could bring down servers, and could easily cost you your job.

*******************************************

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Can check the diff between staging area, working directory, and repository using different forms of git diff.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

While making CR changes after the golden builds! And hey, while making languages work, so that helps as well. You can easily merge later I believe. 

*******************************************

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Well the most obvious thing was it made me understand it as alternate timelines, and since I knew already how alternate timelines work, this one came easy.

For example, in the Flash's alternate timeline of the Flashpoint paradox, he goes back and saves his mother, and then, changes everything. Then he goes back again, and stops the previous self from saving mom, he comes back to his regular timeline

*******************************************

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

When 2 branches are merged together, 2 devs working without each others knowledge, can add 2 diff features, without each other worrying about the others' work working or failing. When 2 branches are merged together, the files get merged from the differen branches. If same files, they get merged, if different files, they get added or deleted as required.


Representing it in this way I think might be called as a vector representation, as it is directional, and helps in understanding the parent commits.
